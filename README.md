# LOCKED-IN

**REAL CHALLENGE GAME** — A social skill-challenge platform where users post video challenges, battle head-to-head in side-by-side comparisons, vote for winners, and "pull up" to real-world events spawned directly from online threads.

---

## What is LOCKED-IN?

LOCKED-IN bridges the gap between online skill videos and real-world competition. Users post short video challenges to a vertical feed, respond to each other's challenges, and the community votes on who wins. When a skill thread heats up enough, anyone can escalate it into a live "Pull Up" event at a real-world location — and the best performers earn a permanent record on their profile.

---

## Key Features

- **Skill Feed** — A TikTok-style vertical feed of skill challenge videos, ranked by engagement (responses + votes) and recency. Supports real-time polling for new posts.
- **Challenge & Response** — Users can post skill videos and respond to challenges with their own videos. Each user is limited to 3 responses per challenge to keep threads competitive.
- **Battle Mode** — When a challenge thread has at least 2 responses, it enters Battle Mode: the top two responders are shown side-by-side and the audience votes for a winner. Competitors cannot vote in their own battles.
- **Voting** — Community members vote for the best skill performer in both online battles and real-world events. A majority-vote threshold determines the official winner.
- **Rematch** — Once a battle ends, either participant can request a rematch, spawning a new challenge thread from the original.
- **Pull Up Events** — Any skill post can be escalated into a scheduled real-world event with a location, player cap, and time window. Players join, check in on the day, upload media, and spectators vote for the winner.
- **Profile & Stats** — Each user profile tracks events joined, events won, and location-specific wins.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

**Backend** — create a `.env` file in the project root (optional for development; required in production):

```
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key   # required in production; defaults to 'locked-in-secret-key' in dev
PORT=3000                    # optional, defaults to 3000
```

**Mobile** — copy `mobile/.env.example` to `mobile/.env` and set the backend URL:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # start dev server with ts-node
npm test           # run Jest integration tests
npm run build      # compile TypeScript to dist/
```

### Mobile

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start     # start Expo dev server
```

## Try the app — no terminal needed

> **Open the link below in any browser. That's it.**

🔗 **[https://elovvaan.github.io/LOCKED-IN](https://elovvaan.github.io/LOCKED-IN)**

No installs, no terminal, no setup. The app loads in your browser and connects to the live backend automatically.

---

**How it works**

| | |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Expo web app — deployed to GitHub Pages automatically on every push to `main` |
| Backend | Express API — already running on Railway at `https://locked-in-production.up.railway.app` |
| Trigger | Push to `main` → GitHub Actions builds the web app → goes live at the URL above |

> **One-time setup for the repo owner:** Go to the repository **Settings → Pages → Source** and set it to **"GitHub Actions"**. After that, every push to `main` automatically re-deploys the app.

---

## Web App on Railway

The backend serves the real LOCKED-IN frontend (Expo web export from `mobile/`) at `/`.

- **Frontend root**: `/`
- **API manifest**: `/api`
- **SPA routes**: fallback to frontend `index.html`
- **Health check**: `/health`
- **Build pipeline**: `npm run build` runs `npm run build:backend` and `npm run build:frontend` (Expo export to `mobile/dist/`)

---

---

## Environment Setup

### Backend — `.env.example`
```env
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NODE_ENV=development
```
Copy to `.env` in the project root before starting the server.

### Mobile — `.env.example` (inside `mobile/`)
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
Copy to `mobile/.env` before starting the Expo app.

## Core Gameplay Loop

```
1. User registers / logs in
        ↓
2. User browses the Feed (active events & skill posts)
        ↓
3. User creates or joins a Challenge Event
        ↓
4. User submits a video/photo as proof of completion
        ↓
5. Other participants vote on the submission
        ↓
6. Event closes → results calculated → winner decided
        ↓
7. User shares or responds to Skill Posts in the skills feed
```

## Known Limitations / Not Yet Implemented

- **Media storage**: `EventMedia` model exists but binary files are not persisted to disk or cloud storage yet.
- **Real-time**: No WebSocket or push-notification layer; clients must poll for updates.
- **Database**: SQLite is used for development/testing; not suitable for multi-instance production deployments.
- **Image/video playback**: The mobile UI does not yet render submitted media inside event or skill screens.
- **User profiles**: Profile screen exists but editing (avatar, bio) is not wired to the API.
- **Authorization**: Basic JWT auth is in place; per-resource ownership checks are minimal.

---

## Next Milestones / Build Roadmap

| Milestone | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| M1 | Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL; add migrations |
| M2 | Wire media upload to S3-compatible storage |
| M3 | Add WebSocket layer for live vote counts |
| M4 | Complete profile edit flow (avatar + bio) |
| M5 | Push notifications for event results |
| M6 | Public TestFlight / Play Store beta |

## Creator Revenue Chain Layer

The app keeps media/content **off-chain** and mirrors rights + settlement state in the API database to represent the on-chain layer for fast UI/analytics.

- Off-chain concerns: content storage, analytics, feeds/ranking, private context, app business logic
- On-chain mirrored state: creator registry, asset registry, split routing, license state, royalty rules, treasury vaults, entitlement records
- Settlement defaults: **USDC** on **Base** with embedded-wallet-style UX

Key endpoints (auth required):

- `GET /revenue/config`
- `POST /revenue/creators/register`
- `POST /revenue/assets`
- `POST /revenue/tips`
- `POST /revenue/subscriptions`
- `POST /revenue/unlock`
- `POST /revenue/licenses`
- `POST /revenue/royalties/resale`
- `POST /revenue/payouts`
- `GET /revenue/vaults/me`
- `GET /revenue/entitlements/me`

## Local Development Notes

### Starting the Backend
```bash
# From the project root
cp .env.example .env          # set PORT, JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV
npm install
npm run dev                   # ts-node src/index.ts — hot reload via ts-node
```
The server starts on `http://localhost:3000` by default.  
Run tests with `npm test` (uses in-memory SQLite; no `.env` required).

### Starting the Mobile App
```bash
# From the mobile/ directory
cp .env.example .env          # set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL
npm install
npx expo start                # opens Expo DevTools / QR code
```

### API Base URL Behavior
- The mobile app reads `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` at build time via Expo's public env system.
- Default is `https://locked-in-production.up.railway.app` (the live Railway backend).
- **Physical device / Expo Go**: if you want to point at a local server, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your machine's LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:3000`).
- **Android emulator**: use `http://10.0.2.2:3000`.

### How Mobile Connects to the Backend
### How Mobile Connects to the Backend
The Axios client in `mobile/src/lib/api.ts` picks up `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` and prefixes every request with it. The GitHub Actions deployment sets this to the Railway URL automatically — no `.env` file needed.

---

## Mobile Release (EAS Build + Store Submission)

From `mobile/`:

1. Configure env values in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`).
2. Log into Expo: `npx eas login`
3. Link project and set credentials:
   - `npx eas project:init` (if not already linked)
   - `npx eas credentials`
4. Build production binaries:
   - iOS: `npx eas build --platform ios --profile production`
   - Android: `npx eas build --platform android --profile production`
5. Submit to stores:
   - iOS: `npx eas submit --platform ios --profile production`
   - Android: `npx eas submit --platform android --profile production`

Required secrets/vars:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- `EXPO_OWNER`
- `EAS_PROJECT_ID`
- `IOS_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`
- `ANDROID_PACKAGE`
- `APPLE_ID`, `ASC_APP_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (iOS submit)
- `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (raw JSON for Android submit service account)
- Generate `mobile/google-play-service-account.json` with `npm run prepare:google-play-key` from `mobile/` before `eas submit --platform android`
